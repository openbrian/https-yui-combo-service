# Why YUI Combo Service over HTTPS #
YUI Dependency Configurator is a great tool for getting a single unified JS or CSS instead of several files. Only problem with that is it doesn't works over "HTTPS". Browser's like **Internet Explorer** fail to load a web page delivered over HTTPS having JS/CSS delivered over un-secure(HTTP) URLs.

## The Good News :-) ##
Though YUI team left a great possibility to change the combo base for service. This project uses the same possibility to give a secure combo base wrapper over unsecure YUI Combo Service.
